1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are working on a project with multiple people.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might be in the middle of a code that I donâ€™t want to share yet.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is basically same as clone but it replicates a repository on the GitHub. Clone is when we copy a repository from GitHub to our local directory or from local to local. Branch is when we make a new commit while keeping the old commit for further changes in other direction.

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can know how how the others changed the code last and you can use your own changes to combine with their modifications. 

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I have to send the code each time which ends in lots of files being exchanged. It is way easier with Github of course.
