1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are working on a project with multiple people.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might be in the middle of a code that I donâ€™t want to share yet.
